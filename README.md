# Juliana A Game Design Labs
 A repo containing all my lab assignments for Intro to Video Game Design

Lab 1: I really like ducks so I created a scene in a forest with some ducks and chicks and included a lake for them to hang out around. I learned how to change the background color of the scene by googling a tutorial and had fun learning how to move the sprites around and size them to fit within the lines of the scene.
