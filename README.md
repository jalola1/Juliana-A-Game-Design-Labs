# Juliana A Game Design Labs
 A repo containing all my lab assignments for Intro to Video Game Design

Lab 1: I really like ducks so I created a scene in a forest with some ducks and chicks and included a lake for them to hang out around. I learned how to change the background color of the scene by googling a tutorial and had fun learning how to move the sprites around and size them to fit within the lines of the scene.

Lab 2: Continuing with the duck theme, I made a duck node and wrote a script that had conditional logic, making it respond to user input. Now I can use my up, down, left and right keys to move the duck around. 

Lab 4: I learned how to create CSG shapes and added a camera, light source, and a controllable 3D character.
